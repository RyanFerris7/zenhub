# Create your views here.
# 
# RULES 
#
# 1. Do not edit or adjust anyone else's code.
#
# 2. If something needs to be changed, just ask 
#    the person who wrote it. 
#
# 3. Add as many lines as you need to your sections.
#
# 4. Use comments to to help everyone else read the 
#    code and understand what it does. 
#
# 5. Always pull before pushing, it'll help prevent
#    merge conflicts.
